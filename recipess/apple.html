    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This classic holiday staple has a very long history in the home 
        the Queen herself, England! Though it may seem like a ordinary 
        treat today, it was very much a delicacy reserved for special 
        occasions. Though it originated in England, the English bakers 
        had culinary influences from France, the Netherlands, and even
        the Ottoman Empire as early as the year 1390.</p>
    <p>Now with the history of apple pie out of the way, it is time to  
        elaborate why this recipe is called Uncle Karim's Apple Pie!  
        It all starts with Karim's inability to cook. He makes the same 
        simple dishes every time he cooks. Of which aren't very flavorful 
        or stand out in any way. This leads Karim to take a backseat as 
        his two roommates do all of the cooking for the group. His baking 
        passion started as a way for him to contribute in the kitchen. 
        What makes Uncle Karim's Apple Pie different is the addition 
        of walnuts!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Now with that being said, below are the ingredients that are needed for todays recipe!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>9 inch double crust pie</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 tbl all-purpose flower</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup of Walnut half's and pieces</li>
        <li>8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>After collecting all of the necessary ingredients, it is finally

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the 
            butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add 
            water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. 
            Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
        <li>Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, 
            mounded slightly. Sprinkle walnuts haphazardly between apple
            pieces. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently 
            pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour 
            slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
        <li>Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature 
            to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to
