    <h2>Eden's Peppermint Sweet Potato Casserole</h2>
    <img src="/Users/karimsanad/Downloads/recipe website/potato.jpg" width="300px" height="auto">
    <p>The first recipe for marshmallow-topped sweet potato casserole 
        was actually published by a marshmallow manufacturer in 1917. 
        This instant classic dish quickly gained many variations to its 
        recipe. In the South East coast of the US cream and milk were 
        added to the recipe to give it a smoother flavor. Pecans quickly 
        became a staple of many casseroles.</p>
    <p>Todays special recipe by Eden got its origins with his favorite 
        snack, peppermint! Now get turned off by the idea of peppermint 
        on sweet potato casserole, imagine the sweetness of the marshmallow 
        and richness of the sweet potato being uplifted with the light 
        sweetness of peppermint. Still can't imagine that? That's tuff. 
        I guess you have to make Eden's recipe and prove your small brain 
        wrong.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Still trying to wrap your brain around the flavor combination of 
        sweet potato, marshmallow, and peppermint? Of course it is you 
        small brained human. Now lets go over the ingredients you'll be 
        needing to expand your feeble mind.
    <ul>
        <li>5 sweet potatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup reduced fat margarine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons orange juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounces) package miniature marshmallows</li>
        <li>1 bottle (2 ounces) of peppermint crunch</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>Stop thinking about the flavor combination human, simply follow 
        the recipe. Now that you have all the ingredients together, the 
        next part is quite simple! Hopefully...
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place sweet potatoes in a large saucepan with enough 
            water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, 
            about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, drain, and mash.</li>
        <li>Place mashed sweet potatoes in large bowl, and use an 
            electric mixer to blend with the margarine, brown sugar, 
            orange juice, cinnamon, and lastly peppermint crunch. 
            Spread evenly into a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with 
            miniature marshmallows.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or 
            until heated through, and marshmallows are puffed and 
            golden brown.</li>  
    </ol>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Even though accidentally revealed that I'm not really human, I doubt 
        you'll actually remember pea brained human. Luckily you finally have 
        Eden's Peppermint Sweet Potato Casserole, how was it! Do you finally 
        understand the complexity of the flavors? Yes? Great! Now share it
