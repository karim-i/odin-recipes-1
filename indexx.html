    <h2>Thanksgiving Special Recipes!</h2>
    <p>The best recipes come from those who pour their love into 
        their dishes. I believe the best time of the year lasts 
        from October to the end of December. This is when there 
        are stores, workplaces, and even neighborhoods collectively
        decide to change how their locations look. If there is one 
        thing I personally love is positive change. A massive part 
        of the reason behind my love for the holiday season is the 
        role food plays in bringing friends and loved ones alike 
        together! That is what lead to me changing this whole 
        website to showcase recipes I hope you all use as an excuse 
        to bring your friends and loved ones together. Much like I do!</p>
    <h2>Our Staff Picks</h2>

    <h3><a href="recipess/apple.html">Uncle Karim's Apple Pie</a></h3>
    <p>The first dish is a holiday classic but with a nutty twist!
        Done with fresh Granny Smith Apples, cinnamon, and the secret
        ingredient... walnuts!</p>

    <h3><a href="recipess/potato.html">Eden's Sweet Potato Casserole</a></h3>
    <p>Eden's renovation to the classic sweet potato casserole brings 
        a whole new dimension to the flavor. Hopefully you don't get lost 
        in what Eden calls "The Tiers of Sweetness".</p>

    <h3><a href="recipess/dip.html">David's Spinach Artichoke Dip</a></h3>
    <p>With a rather short history, Spinach and Artichoke dip quickly became 
        the king of dips. Now with Davids creamy homemade variation to the 
        classic recipe, it can officially be called the greatest dip to bring 
        to any event!</p>
