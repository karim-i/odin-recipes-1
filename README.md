PROJECT 1: Recipe YES
In Recipe, I will be using my basic knowledge of HTML to build a website with a main index page including links to few recipes. This project will be an application of my HTML fundamentals. 


Before PROJECT 1: Recipe YES

Just like packing down the sand before the setting of pavers, I believe that this project will act as the packing of my minds loose sand knowledge. I go into this project with a fundamental knowledge of the structure, elements, and attributes of HTML and hope to pack it down into reflexes.
